# 🔐 RSA Cryptosystem Project

### 🔮 About

**This is a project part of the CyberSec class MSID 2022/2023, taught by Mr. ZINE-DINE Khalid**. The objective of this assignment is to create an (interactive) program implementing the RSA algorithm allowing to:

- Generate RSA keys (Cryptosystem)
- Encrypt an input message (Plaintext)
- Decrypt an encrypted message (Ciphertext)

### 💻 How does it work?

1. Enter the text you want to encrypt and click "🔓 Encrypt Message"
2. A pair of public and private key will be generated
3. Your plaintext is now in ciphertext
4. Enter the ciphertext and private key in the "🗝️ Decrypt a ciphertext"
5. Decrypt your message

### Installation : 
1. Clone the repository:

```git clone https://github.com/Hamagistral/RSA-Crypto-Project.git```

2. Change directory to streamlit/ :

```cd streamlit/```
  
2. Install the required packages:

```pip install -r requirements.txt```

### Usage : 

1. Run the app:

```streamlit run rsa_ui.py```
